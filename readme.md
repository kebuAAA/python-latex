# The art of Latex with the help of python
A simple latex template for course paper. As a beginner of Latex and a pythoner, I feel so good using python to produce beautiful data visualization and latex tables using `pd.DataFrame.to_latex()`. I can also use latex to generate my paper efficiently with the help of python while not so good at latex. 

Maybe many methods in [guide pdf](guide.pdf) are not the best way in the latex world, but they are the preferred way for pythoner. This repo just provides a guide to use python to generate latex paper.
